This folder contains cryptographic and string-obfuscation routines.

cipher.py contains nine functions involved in the cipher / decipher functionality.

Cross-language cipher compatibility with corresponding VBA and SQL Server implementations enabled deterministic encoding and decoding across the application stack:

"elevantcoding/vba-methods/security/StringCipher.bas"  
"elevantcoding/sql-methods/security/    
      elevant.CipherString.sql"  
      elevant.DecipherString.sql"  
      elevant.GetAlterVals.sql"  
      elevant.GetCipherString.sql"
